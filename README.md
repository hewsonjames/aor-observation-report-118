# AOR 5357-23 — Multi-Unit (102 & 118)

This app bundles both **Unit 102** and **Unit 118** with an in-app unit switcher.
It keeps the exact layout, dual signatures, photo evidence with multi-criteria, auto-Obs mapping, save/load per unit, and A4 PDF export.

## Publish
1. Create a public repo (e.g., aor-102-118-report).
2. Upload *all* files from this zip to the repo root.
3. Settings → Pages → Deploy from a branch → main / (root) → Save.
4. Open on iPad and Add to Home Screen.

## Notes
- **Unit switch** at the top chooses which criteria tables are visible.
- **Save/Load** is *per unit*. Switching units changes the storage key, so you can keep separate drafts.
- Export prints the currently selected unit's page.
